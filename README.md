## Games

### Digital Board Games

There are several different options here, digital implementations of board games, gaming simulators and online versions of games. Join a voice chat with your friends, and all play a game together.

#### Online Games

There are many different board game sites where you can play board games online for free. Some offer premium features for extra payment. The selection of games depends on the website.

- [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/) - 600+ games, inbcluding Sub Terra, Scythe, Love Letter and Santorini
- [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/) - 150+ games including Race for the Galaxy, 7 Wonders, Carcasonne and Coup
- [Yucata](https://www.yucata.de/en) - 100+ games, including Stone Age, Castles of Burgundy and El Grande
- [BrettspielWelt](http://www.brettspielwelt.de/?nation=en) - 50+ games, including 7 Wonders, Carcasonne, Settlers of Catan

#### Gaming Simulators

[Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/) emulates a 3D environment with a table, which you can "sit" around and interact with as you would in real life. Once you have the hang of how to manipulate the environment, you can play thousands of games. 

Be aware that only a few of the games available are "legitimate" implementations and available for purchase, the majority of games are clones built by the community. Uou can download them from the [workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=286160&browsesort=totaluniquesubscribers). Examples include UNO, The Settlers of Catan and Carcasonne.

One downside is that all your players need to own a copy of Tabletop Simulator to join. It's currently available for 50% off at [Fanatical](https://tabletopsimulator.com/news/announcements) and activates on Steam. Additionally, only a few of the games are scripted, meaning it's up to the players to know how to play correctly and manipulate the pieces, as you would in person. 

#### Digtal Board Game Implementations

Recently, several publishers have been releasing digital versions of their board games for purchase. Again, a downside is that, usually, all the players need to own a copy, but you're rewarded with a high quality digital implementation, that's usually scripted. Some popular games include:

- [RISK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128810/RISK_Global_Domination/) - 1-6 player, fully licensed copy of the classic area control game
- [UNO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/470220/UNO/) - 1-4 players, classic card game of color and number matching
- [Skythe: Digital Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/) - 1-5 player, an engine building war and territory control game
- [Charterstone](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046660/Charterstone_Digital_Edition/) - 2-6 player, campaign based strategy game

More can be found on the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Board+Game), and [Humble](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/search?sort=bestselling&genre=tabletop) Stores

### Jackbox Games

Jackbox Games are local multiplayer games designed to play with a group of friends on the same screen using everyone's mobile phones. However, they work surprisingly well over the internet. Setup a voice call, share your screen, and have people join the game from their phone or laptop.

Games include:

 - Drawful - draw prompts and guess what your friends drew (currently [free](https://jackboxgames.com/drawful-two/) on some platforms)
 - Quiplash - answer a prompt, then vote for your favourite responses
 - Fibbage - create fake answers to trivia questions to trick your friends

They have a tutorial on [how to set up Jackbox for remote play](https://jackboxgames.com/how-to-play-jackbox-games-with-friends-and-family-remotely/). You can use any tool that can capture your screen, such as Google Hangouts, Zoom or Discord.
