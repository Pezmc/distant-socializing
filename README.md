## Games

### Digital Board Games

There are several different options here, digital implementations of board games, gaming simulators and online versions of games. Join a voice chat with your friends, and all play a game together.

#### Online Games

There are many different board game sites where you can play board games online for free. Some offer premium features for extra payment. The selection of games depends on the website.

- [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/) - 600+ games, including Sub Terra, Scythe, Love Letter and Santorini

##### Specific Suggestions

Some games with a low barrier to entry that work well remotely!

- [Secret Hitler](https://secrethitler.io/) - a social deduction game for 5-10 players ([alternative](http://secret.ethanl.ee))
- [Codenames](https://www.horsepaste.com/) - a clue giving game for two teams, 4+ players
- [Cards Against Humanity](http://playingcards.io/game/remote-insensitivity) - a party game with fill in the blanks ([alternative](https://pyx-1.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/game.jsp))
- [Coup](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=coupcitystate) - a strategy and bluffing game for 2-6 players
- [Telestrations](https://drawception.com/dashboard/) - the telephone game but with drawings 6/12/15 players
- [Settlers of Catan](https://catanuniverse.com/en/game/) - the classic board game in your browser for free

#### Gaming Simulators

[Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/) emulates a 3D environment with a table, which you can "sit" around and interact with as you would in real life. Once you have the hang of how to manipulate the environment, you can play thousands of games. 

Be aware that only a few of the games available are "legitimate" implementations and available for purchase, the majority of games are clones built by the community and rely on the honour system. You can download them from the [Steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=286160&browsesort=totaluniquesubscribers). Examples include UNO, The Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.

One downside is that all your players need to own a copy of Tabletop Simulator to join. It's currently available for 50% off at [Fanatical](https://tabletopsimulator.com/news/announcements) and activates on Steam. Additionally, only a few of the games are scripted, meaning it's up to the players to know how to play correctly and manipulate the pieces, as you would in person. 

#### Digital Board Game Implementations

Recently, several publishers have been releasing digital versions of their board games for purchase. Again, a downside is that, usually, all the players need to own a copy, but you're rewarded with a high quality digital implementation, that's usually scripted. Some popular games include:

- [RISK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128810/RISK_Global_Domination/) - 1-6 player, fully licensed copy of the classic area control game
- [UNO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/470220/UNO/) - 1-4 players, classic card game of color and number matching
- [Scythe: Digital Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/) - 1-5 player, an engine building war and territory control game
- [Charterstone](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046660/Charterstone_Digital_Edition/) - 2-6 player, campaign based strategy game

More can be found on the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Board+Game), and [Humble](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/search?sort=bestselling&genre=tabletop) Stores

### Local Multiplayer "Dial In" Games

#### Jackbox Games

Jackbox Games are local multiplayer games designed to play with a group of friends on the same screen using everyone's mobile phones. However, they work surprisingly well over the internet. Setup a voice call, share your screen, and have people join the game from their phone or laptop.

They have a tutorial on [how to set up Jackbox for remote play](https://jackboxgames.com/how-to-play-jackbox-games-with-friends-and-family-remotely/). You can use any tool that can capture your screen, such as Google Hangouts, Zoom or Discord.

#### AirConsole

Similar to Jackbox, these are local multiplayer games designed for couch play. Players connect using their smartphones, perfect for playing online. Share your screen on a video call, and have people dial in! A few games are available for free, but you need a $4.99/month membership to access them all, they do offer a free trial

### Role Playing

Role playing games such as DnD, can easily be moved into the virtual world.
You can play without any tools at all, but it might be easier to make use of a website such as [Roll20](http://roll20.net]), [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php), or [Tabletop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/).

## Activities

### Watch a Film

Hop on a voice or video call and all start watching a film on your favourite streaming service, or live TV at the same time. It's _almost_ like being in the same room. Though you'll have to all hit play at exactly the same time!

### Netflix Party

[Netflix Party](https://www.netflixparty.com/) is a Chrome Extension that sync's a Netflix video between several computers and adds group chat. For a monthly donation, it also includes built in voice chat, but you could also use another conferencing tool. Your friends will need a paid Netflix subscription to watch.

Choose your favourite TV show or Movie, use the extension to start a party, then send the link to your friends. They'll see the video and it will be kept in sync between you all! It only works on the computer, so if you want to watch on the TV you'll need to plug your laptop or desktop in! 

### Host a Quiz

Prepare some trivia questions by googling  "trivia questions" for resources, then hop on your favourite video chat, or use a streaming service such as Twitch, Facebook Live, or YouTube Live. You're in charge, but the general format would be several rounds of categories, followed by general knowledge questions. Then you can read out the answers and have your friends mark themselves!

### Parlour Games Over Video Chat

There's a whole bunch of classic parlour games that can be easily adapted to video calls.
Examples include:

 - Truth or dare
 - Kiss, Marry, Kill
 - Would you Rather?
 - Never have I ever
